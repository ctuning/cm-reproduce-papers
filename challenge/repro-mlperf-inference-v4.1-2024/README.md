Anyone is welcome to participate in the MLPerf inference v4.1 community submission to benchmark any commodity hardware and software using MLPerf and CM.

Pease follow this [official MLCommons documentation](https://docs.mlcommons.org/inference) to run MLPerf inference v4.1 benchmark.

We recommend to use [this guide](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=install) 
to install CM instead of the MLCommons one since the last one is not yet stable.

If you encounter issues, please report them [here](https://github.com/mlcommons/cm4mlops/issues).

Remember that you need to be an official MLCommons member to submit your results.

Deadline: 26 July 2024
